The better fact table part in sql:


/* Fact table part*/
create table Sales (
    sale_id NUMBER UNIQUE,
    quantity number,
    price number,
    discount number,
    
    /* Foreign keys */
    user_id number,
    customer_id number, 
    outlet_name Varchar(60),
    product_id number, 
    payment_type Varchar(60),
    sale_date DATE,
    
    CONSTRAINT Foreign Key (user_id) References staff(user_id),
    CONSTRAINT Foreign Key (customer_id) References customer(customer_id),
    CONSTRAINT Foreign Key (outlet_name) References location(outlet_name),
    CONSTRAINT Foreign Key (product_id) References product(product_id),
    CONSTRAINT Foreign Key (payment_type) References payment_type(payment_type),
    CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (sale_date) REFERENCES sale_date(sale_date),
 
    CONSTRAINT Primary Key (sale_id)
);


Analytic queries-should be similar to lecture handout:



select Product_ID, Name, Supplier, Brand, Product_Type,
    round(avg(Unit_Cost) over (partition by Supplier), 2) as Avg_Cost_Supplier,
    round(avg(Unit_Cost) over (partition by Brand), 2) as Avg_Cost_Brand,
    round(avg(Unit_Cost) over (partition by Product_Type), 2) as Avg_Cost_Type
from is303.Product
order by Product_ID;
 
with Ranked as 
    (select Customer_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, sum(Quantity * Price) as total,
        rank() over(order by sum(Quantity * Price) desc) as Customer_Rank
    from is303.Customer inner join IS303.sale_head using (Customer_ID)
            inner join IS303.sale_line using (Sale_ID)
    group by Customer_ID, First_Name, Last_Name)
    select Customer_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, total
    from Ranked
    order by Customer_Rank;
    
    
with Ranked as 
    (select Product_ID, Name, Product_Type, sum(Quantity) as newQuan,
        rank() over (partition by Product_Type
            ORDER BY sum(Quantity) ASC) as Product_Rank
    from is303.Product inner join IS303.sale_line using (Product_ID)
    group by Product_ID, Name, Product_Type)
select Product_ID, Name, Product_Type, newQuan
from Ranked
where Product_Rank = 1
order by Product_Type;
